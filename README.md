## 100% Personal created portfolio
The 2nd edition of my personal portfolio.

 

## Usage
## LIFX/IOT - First Project!
To utilize the LIFX weather project you will need a LIFX ```client_id``` token and ```client_id``` from your own purchased device. Apologies for this. This is out of our hands at this point as LIFX does not provide trial/guest token generation options for, 'small' projects.
