## Usage
## LIFX/IOT - First Project!
To utilize the LIFX weather project you will need a LIFX ```client_id``` token and ```client_id``` from your own purchased device. Apologies for this. This is out of our hands at this point as LIFX does not provide trial/guest token generation options for, 'small' projects.

## Hangman Game
- output is still an issue

## Wins

## 100% personally created portfolio
- For a fun way to choose my color scheme I used [Color Leap](https://colorleap.app/home). (I chose the second pot down in year 0)
## Personal Domain! 
Welcome to the launch of scottyhansford.com! I found the ease of github-pages combined with the ```terminal``` and I had to figure out how to connect to a real domain.
